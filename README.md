#### Step 3: Install MaxPhisher
Install MaxPhisher using pip3:

#### Step 4: Grant Execution Permissions
Navigate to the root directory and make the MaxPhisher script executable. Replace `put_your_gcloud_name` with your specific Google Cloud username:
```bash
chmod +x /home/put_your_gcloud_name/.local/bin/maxphisher
```

Verify the file permissions to ensure the script is executable:
```bash
ls -l /home/put_your_gcloud_name/.local/bin/maxphisher
```
Expected output:
```plaintext
-rwxr-xr-x 1 put_your_gcloud_name put_your_gcloud_name 209 Oct  6 10:07 /home/put_your_gcloud_name/.local/bin/maxphisher
```

#### Step 5: Add MaxPhisher to the PATH
Add the directory containing the MaxPhisher script to your system's PATH variable:

1. Open the `~/.bashrc` file in a text editor:
   ```bash
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. Add the following line at the end of the file:
   ```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:/home/put_your_gcloud_name/.local/bin"
   ```

3. Save the file (Ctrl+O, then Enter) and exit (Ctrl+X).

Reload the updated `~/.bashrc` file:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### Step 6: Run MaxPhisher
You can now run MaxPhisher from anywhere in your Cloud Shell:
```bash
